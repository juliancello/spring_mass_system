# spring_mass_system

In my engineering undergraduate studies, I created a matlab program to simulate applied
differential math, linear algebra, and physics by modeling a system of forces between two spring
coupled masses. This is my python 3.x port of that matlab program. 

Here are some resources for differential equations:
